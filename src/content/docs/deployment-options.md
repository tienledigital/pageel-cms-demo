Pageel CMS can be deployed in various ways depending on your needs.

## Vercel (Recommended)

As it's built with modern frameworks, Vercel offers the best performance and easiest setup.

## Netlify

Another great option for static site hosting.

## Self-hosted

Since it's a client-side app, you can host it anywhere that serves static files.
