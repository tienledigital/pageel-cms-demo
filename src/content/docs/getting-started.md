# Getting Started with Pageel

To start using Pageel CMS with your repository, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a **Fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT)** on GitHub.
2. Grant **Read & Write** permissions for the "Contents" scope.
3. Open Pageel CMS and enter your token and repository name.

## Configuration

Pageel looks for a `.pageelrc.json` file in your repository root to understand your project structure.
